# 🤖 CarryMate: Intelligent Human-Following Robot with Gesture Control

CarryMate is an AI-powered mobile robot designed to autonomously follow a human target using computer vision and hand gesture commands. It leverages YOLOv8 for real-time person detection, ByteTrack for multi-object tracking, and MediaPipe for gesture-based start/stop control.

## 🔍 Project Overview

**CarryMate** aims to reduce physical strain in environments where users need to carry multiple or heavy items — such as warehouses, campuses, or delivery zones. By detecting a person from the back and interpreting simple hand gestures, the robot can smartly follow or stop, acting like a "third hand" for logistics or personal use.
